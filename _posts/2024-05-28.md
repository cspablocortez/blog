title: Hello, Jekyll
---

I decided it'd be fun to set up a Jekyll site since it's 
very similar to what I've already been doing on pandoc to 
manage my personal notes. For anything that would ever be 
published, such as these words, I figured it'd be better to 
adhere to tested solutions rather than write my own makefile 
to convert my files and push them to a remote git 
repository. That was important in my decision, I wanted the 
flexibility of accessing the site's content (which is mostly 
really a bunch of markdown files) from the command line, 
since I rely on nano for longform writing after having 
tweaked its configuration file to make it pleasant to use on 
a Galaxy Tab S7 Plus. 

So here is a short first post to get the ball rolling.
