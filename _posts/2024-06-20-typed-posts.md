Sometimes it’s necessary to animate plain text into existence. 

Text-based content is at a disadvantage when displayed on a screen. It has to compete against images, videos and games for our attention in a medium where text alone seems as appropriate as a video on a paper pamphlet. 

TikTok is an example of a medium where the content distribution strategy evolved to the detriment of plain text. In a deliberate assault of the senses, the platform plays videos automatically to stun and disarm the viewer into consuming content. Unsurprisingly, it works. Hours are sunk into the app by removing the tension between two forces: access and engagement. A new, more exciting video is always one swipe away. And in a few seconds (although seconds seems excessive) I know whether I want to keep watching.

On the other hand, plain text is more demanding despite its simpler nature. It takes longer than a few seconds to engage with it. It takes longer still to decide if I want to stick around to read it all in the first place. And this is assuming that the author has taken the time to present the content in a pleasant format, selecting legible fonts, agreeable margins, decent line-height and other precautions almost always guaranteed in print media. But in the digital space, the formatting and presentation of text-based content is all over the place. Some websites use appalling fonts while others relegate content to favor ad banners, and the tension between access and engagement grows even more strained.

*Reading* is a deliberate act. To read is to engage. We can’t passively read an article the way we passively watch a video. And because it’s a bigger commitment, we need an incentive. 

Most of the time, the incentive is established before engaging with the text. For example, when I read an article on Wikipedia, it will presumably provide information I want to know. Similarly, if I see a flashy headline and click to read more, I want my curiosity satisfied.

Now imagine you’re scrolling on TikTok and a large block of text comes up. 

Q: What incentive do you have to read it and why should you care about it?

A: None. And you probably shouldn’t.

But if we reintroduced curiosity by displaying text piecemeal, we couldn’t help but wonder what’s next.  

I’d like to call this type of content menotext, like hypertext, where the Greek prefix *meno* means to abide, put up with or tolerate. While hypertext is dynamic and connects sources through hyperlinks, menotext favors passive consumption: watch text be animated into existence while reading it.

> **menotext** (n.) &mdash; text-based content adapted for short-form video platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, etc.

I think it’s the equivalent of saying "guess what" to someone and postponing the answer many times over. But it’s really more a fighting chance for plain text in platforms that are actively hostile towards its format.
