Sometimes it’s necessary to animate content into existence. 

The idea came after thinking about TikTok. One of the ways the platform captures attention for hours on end is by removing the tension between having access to and engaging with content. 

In a deliberate assault of the senses, videos start playing automatically to stun and disarm the viewer into engagement: one tap to pause, two to like. A swipe up shows the next video and renews the process.

Plain text is more innocuous. The stakes are clear. **Read if you want.**  It’s *just* text. Sometimes there are many blocks of text and with any luck the author will have taken some time to present the content in a pleasant format. Legible fonts, agreeable margins, decent line-height and other precautions almost always guaranteed in print media. 

In the digital space, formatting is all over the place. Some websites use appalling fonts while others relegate content to favor ad banners. 

And the tension between access and engagement remains.

*Reading* is a deliberate act. To read is to engage. You can’t passively read an article the way you passively watch a video. And because it’s a bigger commitment, the reader needs an incentive. 

Most of the time, the incentive is established before engaging with the text. For example, when I read an article on Wikipedia, it will presumably provide information I want to know. Similarly, if I see a flashy headline and click to read more, I want my curiosity satisfied.

Now imagine you’re scrolling on TikTok and a large block of text comes up. 

Q: What incentive do I have to read this and why should I care about it?

A: None. And you probably shouldn’t.

HyperTexts change this answer.

A: By reintroducing curiosity, you can’t help but care about what’s next. The stakes are hidden away when it’s not clear when (and how) the text ends. 

**HyperText** (n.) &mdash; text-based content adapted for short-form video platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, etc.

So what is a HyperText? 

It’s the equivalent of saying "guess what" to someone and postponing the answer many times over. Although I’d like to think a HyperText is the essence of a TikTok video stripped to its most basic elements.
