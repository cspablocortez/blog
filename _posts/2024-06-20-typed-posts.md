I'd been toying with the idea of developing a blog in which the content is
animated into existence. The premise is simple, the idea is to have a finished
post written in Markdown, processed by Jekyll, and animated on the website
itself using Matt Boldt's [Typed.js library](https://mattboldt.github.io/typed.js/docs/).

The idea was to make the process of reading more interactive. When faced with 
several large blocks of text, more often than not website visitors will move 
away to another site. 

I figured that by having the content be displayed in a piecemeal fashion, there'd
be more of an incentive to stay on the page and discover what else is new.
