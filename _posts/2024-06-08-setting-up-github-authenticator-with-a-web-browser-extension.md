In the left panel, find Access > Password and Authentication. Alternatively just go to <https://github.com/settings/security>

# Update Preferred 2FA Method

For your Preferred 2FA method, select "Authenticator App"

# Scan a QR code

After you have selected the Authenticator App option, Github will provide you with a QR code that you can scan with the Chrome extension you installed. 

# Enter Generated Code

Once you have added your Github account to the Authenticator app, you should see a code generated for you:
